          <p class="text-light">The Silver Blade

            He was the last of his kind, a warrior of the ancient order of the Silver Blade. He had sworn to protect the world from the dark forces that threatened to destroy it, but he had failed. His comrades had fallen one by one, and he had barely escaped with his life. He wandered the lands, hiding his identity and his sword, hoping to find a way to redeem himself.
            
            One night, he came across a village that was under attack by a horde of demons. He saw the villagers being slaughtered and their homes being burned. He felt a surge of anger and pity, and he decided to intervene. He drew his sword, which glowed with a blue light, and charged into the fray.
            
            He fought with skill and courage, cutting down the demons with ease. He felt a familiar thrill, a sense of purpose that he had not felt in a long time. He reached the center of the village, where he saw a young girl being cornered by a large demon. He ran towards her, hoping to save her.
            
            But he was too late. The demon slashed at the girl, wounding her fatally. He cried out in horror and rage, and stabbed the demon in the heart. The demon fell dead, but so did the girl. He knelt beside her, holding her in his arms. He saw her eyes, which were the same color as his sword. She looked at him with gratitude and curiosity.
            
            "Who are you?" she asked weakly.
            
            "I am... I am a Silver Blade," he said.
            
            "A Silver Blade? What is that?" she asked.
            
            "A protector... a guardian... a hero..." he said.
            
            "Then you are my hero," she said. "Thank you for saving me."
            
            She smiled faintly, then closed her eyes. He felt her life slip away from him. He wept bitterly, cursing himself for being too slow, too late.
            
            He buried her near the village, along with the other victims. He carved her name on a wooden cross: Lila.

Otherwise, Acanthus Asphodel would appear on his horse and take them away. Recently, high ranking officials within the Holy City of Haydenbough have begun to go missing and hushed whispers have spoken of sightings of a man in black armor, believed similar to that worn by the Dark Rider.<br>
