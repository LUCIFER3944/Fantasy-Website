        <p class="text-light">Have you ever heard of the “Rhyme of the Dark Rider?” It’s a lullaby recited by parents within the region of Victor’s Reign to scare their children into being good. Otherwise, Acanthus Asphodel would appear on his horse and take them away. Recently, high ranking officials within the Holy City of Haydenbough have begun to go missing and hushed whispers have spoken of sightings of a man in black armor, believed similar to that worn by the Dark Rider.<br>
<br>
      To remain standing, the city will need to come to terms with its own dark secrets, or forever be lost in the blackest night.</p>
